# Chapter 3 Questions 

1. After putting the "new_line()" function after the main function, it is noted that the
code was not able to run due to the function being "out of the scope"

2. Interestingly strings didn't work with the print twice function even though 'a' looks 
really similar to "a", and what's more intersting is that it was able to take in integers
and floats, as long as they correlated to an ASCII value.

3. No you can't do an expression with a non-returning value because a value isn't returned, and you are basically doing an operation to nothing. You can create a function that returns a value, and an example will be shown in the next c++ file.
