1. A call stack is a when values "stack up" on each other. This is a broad generalization
of what it is, but it's basically when values continue to go down this chain of values, 
until a return is reached. In the cases provided below which had an infinite recursion
and a an infinite loop, this stack of values keeps growing and never reaches a return, 
so it is almost "overlowing" and would cause an error.
