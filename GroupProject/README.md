Read a list of integer numbers from a text file. Each number in the file will be separated with a space. Find the largest number in the list and how many times that number appears in the list.
1. The list will be 20 numbers or less; all numbers will be integers (positive and negative) or 0.
2. You do not need to edit this input. Only valid values will be entered.
3. Display the largest number and how many times it appears in the list.
4. The file (list) will contain at least one number.
5. The input will be provided for you to copy and paste into a text file. Internally name this file LargestNumber.txt and it must be stored in C:\Temp. Therefore, the entire file name will be C:\Temp\LargestNumber.txt
